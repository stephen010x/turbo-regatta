# 6.7.1 Interrupt Response Time
The interrupt execution response for all the enabled AVR Â® interrupts is __four clock cycles minimum__. After four clock cycles the program vector address for the actual interrupt handling routine is executed. During this four clock cycle period, the program counter is pushed onto the stack. The vector is normally a jump to the interrupt routine, and __this jump takes three clock cycles.__

If an interrupt occurs when the MCU is in sleep mode, the interrupt execution response time is increased by __four clock cycles__. This increase comes in addition to the start-up time from the selected sleep mode. A return from an interrupt handling routine takes __four clock cycles__. During these four clock cycles, the program counter (two bytes) is popped back from the stack, the stack pointer is incremented by two, and the I-bit in SREG is set

+3 for interrupt jump

3 + 15*2 + 4 = 37

37 + 4 + 3 = 44

44*2*2000 = 176000


176000 / 16MHz = 1.1%


Ahahaha!

Wow. I did the math horribly wrong.
I calculated for 2000 revolutions per *second*, not per minute.

Good heavens.

Alright, the actual calculation,

44*2*2000/60 = 2933

Now, it is going to be larger because I am accumulating a long long rather than an int.

2933 / 16MHz = 0.018%
